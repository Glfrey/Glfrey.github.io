For spring 2017 I served as the module leader for the second year human genetics course at the University of Worcester. In this module, I covered topics such as the human genome project and its updates, the health-related impacts of various large and small-scale genomic mutations, the medical interpretation of pedigrees,the ethics of genomic testing, genomic ancestry and genetic epideniology.
