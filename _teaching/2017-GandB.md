For the Autumn 2017 semester, [Dr. Mike Wheeler] (https://www.worcester.ac.uk/about/profiles/dr-mike-wheeler) and I redesigned the content of the final year undergraduate module "Genomics and Bioinformatics" to feature updated lectures and practical workshops. Through these sessions we were able to provide students both a sound theoretical background and real hands-on experience on the application of bioinformatics in a wide variety of biological feilds. Specific areas I was responsible for included lectures and workshops on phylogenetics, next generation sequence, genome assembly and annotation and transcriptomics.
