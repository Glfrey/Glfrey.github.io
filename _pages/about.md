Hello and welcome to my webpage!

Formally, I am an individual interdisciplinary PhD (IIP) student in computer science and plant genetics at Montana State University. However, I find that's a bit of a mouthful to say (and can take some explaining), so I tend to just say that I'm a joint PhD student in the two subjects. The [IIP](https://www.montana.edu/gradschool/individualinterdisciplinaryphd/index.html) program at MSU is very personalised, and in my case, presented the perfect opportunity for me to explore my interests in plant genetics, computer science and data science, which ultimately aligns with my broad interest in computational biology. I was extremely fortunate to find two supervisors,  [Dr. Jennifer Lachowiec](https://plantsciences.montana.edu/directory/faculty/2030327/jennifer-lachowiec) and [Dr. Veronika Strnadova-Neeley](https://www.cs.montana.edu/directory/2107474/veronika-strnadova-neeley) who were happy to provide me with the joint supervision that is required for such an interdisciplinary program.  My comittee remains balanced between the two disciplines with [Dr. Brendan Mumey](https://www.cs.montana.edu/bmumey/) from the Gianforte school of computing and [Dr. Jamie Sherman](https://plantsciences.montana.edu/directory/faculty/1524593/jamie-sherman) from the department of plant sciences and plant pathology. I am currently in the process of working towards my comprehensive examination, the second of three major stages in my PhD program, having recently passed my qualifying exam this summer. 

As one might expect from a graduate student in an interdisciplinary program, my research interests are broad and I truly enjoy working on a wide variety of topics. My initial research interests in computational biology began with my final year undergraduate research project at the University of Worcester in phylogenetics which was supervised by [Dr. Mike Wheeler](https://www.worcester.ac.uk/about/profiles/dr-mike-wheeler). I have since developed skills in a range of other computational biology topics including RNA-Seq analysis and algorithm design for alternative splice detection, genome assembly and annotation, biological natural language processing (BioNLP) and, more recently, the application of machine learning methods to various biological problems such as miRNA detection and eukaryotic genome assembly. As someones whose educational background is strongly rooted in the biological sciences, I am very fortunate to have been supported in these research explorations by various faculty within the Gianforte school of computing and their graduate students from whom I've learnt, and continue to learn, so much.

Outside of work, I'm a bit of an old woman at heart as I enjoy knitting, crochet, and persuading my poor friends to try my new baking experiments. Perhaps contrastingly, I'm also a rugby fan and I very much look forward to being able to play again once I am able.
